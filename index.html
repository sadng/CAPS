	<p3>As the world erupts, floods, and finds ways to change under our feet, hazardous events
		pose a threat to human life and properties, creating vulnerability in affected communities.
		Unfortunately, some communities do not have the proper hazard education resources that allows
		them to gain hazard awareness. When an event occurs, these communities are left unprepared
		and overwhelmed with feelings of panic, fear, and worry, hoping to find a sense of safety when a
		hazardous event occurs. Understanding the surrounding hazards allows individuals to be
		prepared for these events, making them feel safer as they can acknowledge what the event
		means, how to respond based on personal risk, and how to recover. By using GIS applications,
		preexisting hazard awareness resources, hazard assessment datasets, and historical hazardous
		event records provided by the Hawaii GIS Program and the United States Geological Survey, the
		project created will be a web application that community members of the Hawaiian Islands to
		insert a location onto a map and learn about their local hazards. The hazard assessments included
		will showcase their locationsâ€™ history and projected susceptibility to flooding, tsunamis, fires,
		and lava flows in the future. As a result of using this platform, the community will increase their
		knowledge to create hazard awareness and be useful to future urban developments. Helping the
		communities further prepare for their local hazardous events moving forward, allowing for
		greater resilience through hazard impact recovery.</p3>
